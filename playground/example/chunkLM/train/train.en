Last weekend 's snowfalls , still ongoing , have added on average 30 - 40 cm of fresh snow at 1800 m , with up to 60 cm on the Canin range . The fresh snow does not bind perfectly with the thick underlying layers . At high elevations , the snowpack has been drifted by the wind and has formed conspicuous accumulations on all sides and especially on northern ones . The snowpack is not well settled yet , especially above the tree line . Hence , avalanches of loose snow and slabs may be released naturally in not yet discharged avalanche - prone areas . The discharge of mid-sized slabs may be triggered also by a light load and below the tree line .
Heavy snowfalls are expected on Tuesday and Wednesday morning , especialy on the Carnic Pre-Alps and Carnia and to a smaller extent on the Julian Alps . The expected 50 cm of fresh snow will raise the avalanche danger throughout the mountain area . On Tuesday and Wednesday , several mid-sized avalanches may be discharged naturally from all sides and some large avalanches are also expected . Discharges may disrupt motor traffic in avalanche-prone areas above 900 - 1000 m . The discharge of mid - sized slabs may be triggered also by a light load and below the tree line . Excursions and tours outside controlled areas should be avoided .
On the Alps above 1800 there are spots covered by untransformed snow , especially on northerly sides from South West to North East , where recent and small slabs of wind-drifted snow may be released locally also under a light load . The most dangerous spots are located near ridges and below notches where the wind has drifted most of the snow and the snowpack is still characterized by angular crystals , owing to persistently low temperatures that prevent the top layers from binding with the underlying ones . On the Pre-Alps , danger is lower and limited to discharges triggered by heavy loads only .
No changes in danger level are expected in the next days , as it gets less chilly at top elevations . Nonetheless , marginal discharges of wind-drifted snow slabs may still be triggered by a light load at top Alpine elevations , especially on northerly sides from South West to North East . On the Pre-Alps , danger will remain low and discharges shall be triggered mainly by heavy loads .
The recent snowfalls in the region have added 90 to 130 cm of fresh snow at 1800 m throughout the mountain area . Given the amount of snow and the particular layering of the snowpack , the avalanche danger remains high . Medium and large avalanches may occur naturally in avalanche-prone areas on all sides , but especially on S ones and during the afternoon . Some avalanches could also affect mountain roads running at elevations above 800 - 1000 m . Discharges may be triggered also by a light load and therefore any outdoor activity outside controlled ski runs should be avoided .
The avalanche danger shall remain mostly high throughout the weekend . On Saturday , strong N winds shall promote the formation of new large accumulations , especially on S sides . On Sunday , a light increase in temperature shall promote the discharge of avalanches in the warmest hours . Hence , medium and large avalanches may be released naturally from all sides during the weekend ; S sides are the most dangerous . Avalanches will mostly affect the area above the tree line , though they could also slide down to valley floor and affect mountain roads . Discharges may be triggered also by a light load on all sides and therefore any outdoor activity outside controlled ski runs should not be avoided .
LIght snowfalls have fallen on the mountains of FVG this morning , adding 5 - 10 cm of fresh snow at the higher levels . The decreasing temperature is promoting the gradual settlement of the snowpack , especially at low to medium elevations . At higher elevations instead , especially on N sides , are conspicuous accumulations of snow that is not yet perfectly bound to the underlying layers . On steep slopes above 1800 on N sides and 1900 - 2000 m on S ones , small and medium avalanches may still be triggered by a light load . Natural discharges mainly consist in small avalanches from protruding cliffs and along gullies . However , there may still be some mid-sized ground avalanches on meadowy slopes , especially on S sides .
The forecast weather conditions shall not promote the rapid settlement of the snowpack in the upper levels . Winds shall form new accumulations , partly poorly bound to the underlying layers . On Tuesday , on steep slopes above 1800 m on N sides and 1900 - 2000 m on S ones , medium slab avalanches could still be triggered also by a light load , though discharges under a light load may also affect very steep slopes , especially on N sides . Natural discharges will mainly consist in small avalanches from protruding cliffs and along gullies . However , there may still be some mid-sized ground avalanches on meadowy slopes , especially on S sides and at medium to low elevations .
The snow cover appears stable and well-consolidated in the early morning , owing to the presence of surface melt-freeze crusts . With the passing of the hours , the heavy daylight warming will favour the melting of surface layers , causing the spontaneous avalanche activity to resume . Therefore , from the late morning , starting from E and S exposures and gradually extending to the others , moist or wet snow avalanches , even mid-sized , may release spontanously . The avalanche activity is characterised by releases of both loose snow and slabs , including bottom slabs , on very steep grassy slopes . Above the tree line , triggered releases are again possible from the late morning , even with light overloads .
The avalanche danger until Tuesday will stay unchanged and will be mostly weak in the morning , rapidly increasing from mid-morning , reaching the " considerable " degree . During the warmest hours mid-sized avalanches , both as soft slabs and as loose snow , either moist or wet , may release spontaneously along the usual paths on all exposures . The releases may also involve the bottom layers , particularly on grassy or shrubby slopes . From the late morning , releases may also be triggered by light overloads . Any hikes outside beaten ski runs will have to conclude , preferably , by noon , taking care to accurately assess altitudes and exposures .
The snow cover appears generally stable and well-consolidated in the early morning , owing to the presence of supporting surface melt - freeze crusts . The strong daytime warming is favouring the melting of surface layers . Thus , from the late morning on , spontaneous releases of generally small avalanches of moist or wet snow may again occur . Wet or bottom slab avalanches are not excluded from very steep grassy or shrubby slopes , not yet cleared , in this case , even mid-sized . Above the tree line , triggered releases are again possible from the late morning , even with light overloads .
The weak snow precipitations expected in the night above 1,800 m will not change the level of danger during Tuesday , which will stay mostly weak in the morning , increasing in the warmest hours . The heavy warming expected on Wednesday and , particularly , Thursday will increase the avalanche danger . Particularly from Wednesday on , diffuse spontaneous releases of small avalanches of wet , generally loose , snow may occur on steep slopes on all sides . Residual spontaneous releases of slabs , even mid - sized , from extremely steep grassy slopes not yet unloaded on all sides cannot be ruled out yet . Snow cornices may also collapse . From the late morning , releases may also be triggered by light overloads .
The snow cover appears well settled early in the morning , because of the temperature drop in the night , which however remained positive , determining snow cohesion through capillarity or , in N shaded exposures at high altitudes , freeze crusts . During the morning high temperatures are setting in even in shaded exposures , causing a weakening of surface layers Therefore , from the late morning , the spontaneous release of generally small avalanches of wet snow is likely . Triggered releases of small loose and wet snow avalanches are again possible from the late morning , even with light overloads .
The danger will stay unchanged although the expected thunderstorms may weigh down on the surface layers . Early in the morning the snow cover will continue to be well consolidated , while the high daily temperatures , with possible rainfalls in the afternoon , will continue to favour spontaneous releases of generally loose wet snow avalanches , sometimes even small-sized , on steep slopes on all sides . From the late morning releases of small avalanches of loose snow may still be triggered by light overloads .
Very strong natural-release avalanche hazard in all the areas neighbouring Piedmont !
Over the last 12 hours , medium - and large-size avalanches of dry loose snow have fallen at all aspects above 2000 m , scouring the former snowpack and leaving huge deposits of humid snow . In the RhÃªmes , Valsavarenche , Cogne e Gressoney valleys they reached the valley floor , involving routes , power lines and damaging woods and , in some cases , houses and buildings . The large amounts of snow fallen until now , the close to 0 CELSIUSDEGREE temperature below 2000 - 2200 m and the unceasing wind-drifting of the recent snow above 2200 m make the current condition suitable for the release of surface or ground medium - and large-size avalanches that will very likely reach the valley floor .
Widespread snowfall from valley floor level , moderate to strong in the south east area . Moderate to strong East South East wind at high altitude . Lightly increasing temperature . Freezing level at 1200 m .
The humid southerly stream affecting our Region since last Saturday has brought above 1500 m until now 100 - 120 cm of new snow in the Gressoney , Champorcher , Cogne , Valsavarenche and RhÃªmes valleys and 30 - 90 cm elsewhere . Lower amounts of new snow are reported in the Valpelline , Gran San Bernardo and Monte Bianco areas . Over the precipitation , the snow level did range from valley floor level to 1000 - 1200 m , making the snowpack humid up to 1500 - 1700 m . The strong south easterly wind that accompanied the precipitation is moderate at the moment and goes on drifting the recent snow at all aspects . Above the treeline the old snow cushions , common at all aspects , are now overloaded by the new snow . Generally the snow cover distribution is continuous from valley floor level , except in the main valley from Aosta to Pont Saint Martin where it 's continuous above 700 - 900 m due to the rain .
At all aspects the new snow , moistened up to 1300 - 1500 m , leans on a thick layer of loose snow . In the inner snowpack compact layers mainly formed by facets are present ; below 2000 - 2100 m , a frozen layer of rounds is found close to the ground which represents a dangerous gliding surface . The large amounts of new snow make poor the bonding of the snowpack .
Very strong natural-release avalanche hazard in all the areas neighbouring Piedmont !
Widespread precipitation , moderate in the south east area , snow level at 500 - 700 m . Moderate easterly wind at high altitude , expected to decrease . Lightly increasing temperature in the valleys . Freezing level at 1300 m . As an effect of the moderate to strong precipitation and the unceasing wind at high altitude forecasted in the next 24 - 36 hours , the avalanche hazard level is expected to keep steady on the whole Region . We recommend avoiding every ski activity out of controlled areas . Last snowfall in the morning , sunny spells in the afternoon . Weak northerly wind at high altitude , going to increase . Increasing temperature in the valleys , decreasing at high altitude . Freezing level at 1000 m . The forecast weather condition , the gradual settlement of the recent snow and the natural release activity of the slopes make possible a general decrease of the avalanche hazard level to 4-strong on the whole Region . The triggering of slabs and loose snow avalanches , even of large size , keeps likely by low overloading .
Avalanche hazard 4-strong in RhÃªmes , Valsavarenche , Cogne , Champorcher , Gressoney and Ayas valleys
In the last 24 hours we had surveyed , at all aspects above 1800 m , natural releases of loose snow and slabs , medium and large sized . Mainly at the sunny aspects ground slabs also of medium size have been observed THE AVALANCHE HAZARD LEVEL is rated 4-STRONG IN THE RHÃMES , VALSAVARENCHE , COGNE , CHAMPORCHER , GRESSONEY E AYAS VALLEYS , where natural medium size releases and sometimes large avalanches are still possible . The large amounts of snow , linked to the strong wind and to the current rise in temperature , make the snow condition suitable for the release of surface and ground medium - and large-size avalanches that will very likely reach the valley floor . Elsewhere the avalanche danger level is 3-considerable and the triggering of slabs and loose snow avalanches , even of medium size , remain likely by low overloading .
Mainly sunny weather . Strong northerly wind at high altitude ; foehn in the valleys . Rise in temperature . Freezing level at 1600 m .
The strong northerly wind , involving now all the Region from yesterday , are wind-drifting the snow , building up new considerable accumulations at all aspects . Generally the snow cover distribution is continuous from valley floor level , except in the main valley from Aosta to Pont Saint Martin where it 's continuous above 800 - 1000 m .
Up to 1800 - 2000 m the snowpack is humidified both by the rain of the past days and by the current rise in temperature . Above this level the snowpack is dry . The surface is already redistributed by the wind activity and is locally formed by wind crusts . The large amounts of recent snow lean on a thick layer of loose snow : all together they make poor the bonding of the snowpack . In the inner snowpack compact layers mainly formed by facets are present ; below 2000 - 2100 m , a frozen layer of rounds is found close to the ground which represents a dangerous gliding surface .
On Sunday , because of the rise in temperature , the avalanche danger level is expected to increase in the middle hours of the day .
Sunny weather . Strong or very strong northerly wind at high altitude ; foehn in the valleys . Rise in temperature . Freezing level from 1600 to 1900 m . Related to the forecast snow and weather condition the avalanche danger level is expected to be steady all over the Region . Sunny weather . Strong northerly wind at high altitude ; foehn in the valleys . Rise in temperature . Freezing level from 2200 to 2900 m . The large amounts of snow present on many slopes not yet discharged , the forecast strong rise in temperature and intense wind activity , will furtherly help the natural release activity of medium and large size avalanches , both surface and ground , that could easily reach the valley floor . The avalanche danger level is expected to rise to 5-VERY STRONG on midday IN THE RHÃMES , VALSAVARENCHE , COGNE , CHAMPORCHER , GRESSONEY E AYAS VALLEYS . Elsewhere , always on midday , the avalanche hazard degree is expected to increase to 4-strong .
Significant temperature decrease has been observed in the Olympic Mountain Area over the last week . Strong north western winds blew on Wednesday . Snowpack depth is around 20 - 30 cm at 2000 m in altitude , with significant differences due to wind drift . Snow cover distribution is strongly irregular , continuous but scarce above 1600 - 2000 m according to different exposures .
Melt and freeze surface crusts are present on southern slopes , breakable only at highest altitudes . Wind crusts characterize locations exposed to wind action . Dry loose surface snow can be observed on shady slopes above 2000 m . Snowpack layers are made of faceted crystals on shady aspects . Wide eroded zones are present in altitude . Small size windloads are still present in gullies and bowls
Natural avalanche activity is unlikely . Small sized slab triggering may occur at highest altitudes in windloaded areas on shady slopes . Triggering is likely in the event of large additional load .
Sunny skies and low temps are keeping the snowpack bonding unchanged . It is good on southern and western aspects , weak on North and East facing slopes . Strong to moderate north western winds blew on Wednesday 8 and on Thursday 9 . Snowdrift created new windloads , particularly on south eastern slopes . An average snow depth of 40 - 50 cm is registered at 2000 m in altitude . A significant reduction is observed on southern and western slopes . Snow cover distribution is continuous on sunny aspects above 2000 - 2200 m , depending on different zones . We witness breakable melt-freeze crusts on sunny slopes . Poor snowpack bonding is observed on shady slopes . Loose snow is laying on brittle faceted and cup shaped crystal layers on these slopes . Triggering of soft or moderate cohesion slab avalanches could also occur in the event of low additional load , such as a single skier , on northern slopes and in lee areas , in gullies , bowls and wide slopes near the ridges .
Sunny skies and low temps will still preserve scarce snowpack bonding on North and East facing slopes . A considerable avalanche hazard is likely on the whole Alpine Olympic area , due to windloads in altitude . Natural avalanche activity is expected to be limited to small size loose snow avalanches on shady steepest slopes and lee areas . Triggering of soft small and medium size slabs is to be expected on North and on South East facing slopes , in the event of low additional load . Good local assessment capacity is essential for ski-touring over the whole Olympic mountain area .
Snowpack bonding is almost good on southern and western aspects while it is still weak on north north eastern aspects . Last week strong North West winds and consequent snowdrift created new windloads , particularly on south eastern slopes . An average snow depth of 40 - 50 cm is registered at 2000 m in altitude . A significant reduction is observed on southern and western slopes . Snow cover distribution is continuous on sunny aspects above 2000 - 2200 m , depending on different zones . We witness breakable melt-freeze crusts on sunny slopes . Poor snowpack bonding is observed on shady slopes . Loose snow is laying on brittle faceted and cup shaped crystal layers on these slopes . Triggering of slab avalanches is especially likely in the event of high additional loads at large scale . Triggering might also occur with the passage of a single skier locally , on steepest North facing slopes , especially in leeward areas , in gullies , bowls and wide slopes near the ridges above tree line .
Mostly sunny weather conditions or irregular cloudiness still today , associated with a slight temperature increasing and good night time freezing , have been allowing a progressive snowpack bonding . Weak bonding is still observed on North facing slopes on the contrary . Avalanche danger is moderate in general . Considerable hazard rate is signaled locally , at higher altitude in leeward areas where windloads are reported . Natural avalanche releases are absent or unlikely , limited to small size loose snow avalanches on shady steepest slopes and lee areas . Triggering of slabs is especially likely in the event of high additional loads . Triggering might also occur with the passage of a single skier locally , on steep North and South East facing slopes where windloads are still reported . Conditions for ski-touring are generally good , but local danger zone have to be considered appropriately .
Light snowfall have been affecting the Olympic Mountain Area since yesterday evening , bringing till now an average of 15 - 20 cm of new snow in Claviere area , 5 - 10 cm in Bardonecchia and Monti della Luna area , 2 - 4 cm in Sestriere , Pragelato and Sauze d' Oulx area . Moderate to strong south western winds have been blowing during precipitation . Snow level have been variable in the range of 1400 m in the Susa Valley and 1600 m in the Chisone Valley . The new snow is laying on a well bonded snowpack on South and West aspects , weakly bonded on North slopes . An average snow depth of 40 - 50 cm is registered at 2000 m in altitude but snow cover is significantly reduced on southern and western slopes , scanty and irregular in altitude . Slab avalanche triggering is generally likely in the event of high additional loads . Triggering might also occur with the passage of a single skier locally , especially in leeward areas , in gullies , bowls and wide slopes close to the French border . Wet small avalanches could occur on steep northern slopes due to humidification and rain below 1500 - 1700 m a.s.l.
Light snowfall is expected today and , on the border relieves , tomorrow too . Moderate , locally strong in altitude , western winds are likely to create new soft slabs and windloads on western windward aspects and eastern leeside aspects . This is expected particularly on borderlands close to France . Avalanche danger is moderate in general but new windloads in altitude are likely to determine localized considerable avalanche danger . Renewal of natural avalanche activity is likely . Small natural loose snow avalanches could occur on steep slopes on all aspects . Triggering of slabs is especially likely in the event of high additional loads . Triggering might also occur with the passage of a single skier locally on steepest North slopes and on West and East facing slopes where new windloads are expected . Conditions for ski-touring are generally good , but local hazard zones have to be considered appropriately . Possibilities are limited outside ski-run particularly on border relieves close to France .
Light snowfall has brought , above 1300 m a.s.l. , 5 - 15 cm of new snow in the Bardonecchia area , 5 - 10 cm in the Claviere area , 3 - 5 cm elsewhere in the alpine Olympic area in the last 24 hours . Moderate to strong south western winds have been blowing during snowfall , creating eroded areas near the ridges and thick soft slabs on slopes at several aspects . New snow is laying with low adherence on a well bonded snowpack on southern and western slopes , still weakly bonded on northern slopes . An average snow depth of 50 - 60 cm is registered at 2000 m in altitude . Snow cover is very irregular and significantly scanty on southern and western slopes . Soft slab avalanche triggering is generally likely in the event of low additional loads , especially in wood clearings , bowls , gullies and near the ridges .
Weather condition will not change significantly the avalanche danger in the next 24 hours . Moderate south westerly winds are likely to increase soft slabs and windloads on western windward aspects and eastern leeside aspects . This is expected particularly on borderlands close to France . Avalanche danger is expected to remain considerable , due to new windloads in altitude . Natural avalanche activity is likely to be limited to small loose snow avalanches on steep slopes at several aspects . Slab triggering is likely to occur with a single skier overload in windloaded areas on steepest North , West and East facing slopes . Ski-touring possibilities are limited . Local hazard zones have to be considered appropriately .
New snowfalls have affected the whole Olympic Area yesterday , Sunday 19 , bringing an average of 20 - 25 cm of new snow at 2000 m in altitude ( 30 cm max on border relieves close to France ) . Snowfall also affected plain areas . Snowfalls have brought on the whole 50 - 70 cm of new snow in the border area of Bardonecchia , Claviere and Monti della Luna since Thursday 16 , 35 - 50 cm elsewhere in the Olympic area . Moderate to strong south western winds blew in the last days , creating eroded areas near the ridges and thick soft slabs on slopes at several aspects . New snow is lying with low adherence on a well bonded snowpack on southern and western slopes , still weakly bonded on northern slopes . Renewal of natural avalanche activity is likely on all aspects at different altiutudes , especially on sunny steep slopes . Soft slab avalanche triggering is generally likely in the event of low additional loads , especially in wood clearings , bowls , gullies and near the ridges .
The intermittent snowfalls that affected the Olympic mountain area since Thursday 16 finished at night . Sunny or partly cloudy in the mountains is expected . Moderate , locally strong , south westerly winds have been increasing soft slabs and windloads both on south western windward and north eastern leeside slopes . Avalanche danger is expected to remain considerable , due to new windloads in altitude , particularly on border area . Natural avalanche activity is expected . It is likely to be limited to small loose snow avalanches on very steep slopes at several aspects . In some cases , especially in windloaded areas , medium - sized natural releases are possible . Slab triggering is likely to occur with a single skier overload . Ski - touring possibilities are limited . Local hazard zones have to be considered appropriately .
Light dry snowfall , with light eastern winds , have affected the Olympic area since yesterday afternoon , bringing only traces of new snow , lying on the recently fallen snow of last midweek ( 50 - 70 cm in the border area close to France and 35 - 50 cm elsewhere over the Olympic mountains ) . Snow cover conditions are not changing basically . Snowpack depth max value is recorded at 2100 - 2300 m a.s.l. , while it decreases significantly at higher altitude due to wind action . As a matter of fact moderate to strong winds blew during and after the recent snowfalls , creating eroded areas near the ridges and thick soft slabs on slopes at several aspects . Localized turbulence created new windloads on all aspects . Loose snow is lying with low adherence on a well bonded snowpack on S and W slopes , still weakly bonded on N slopes . Renewal of natural avalanche activity is observed at different altitudes . There is still a lot of hanging snow on steepest slopes and cliff which have not been yet purged . Soft and moderate cohesion slabs avalanche triggering is generally likely in the event of low additional loads , especially in wood clearings , bowls , gullies and near the ridges .
Winds rotated from East have been increasing soft slabs and windloads both on eastern windward and western leeside slopes . Avalanche danger will remain considerable on the whole area , due to windloads in altitude . Localized soft slabs are observed at low and medium altitude too . Natural avalanche activity is still expected . It is likely to be limited to small loose snow avalanches on steep slopes at several aspects . In some cases , especially in windloaded areas , medium-sized natural releases are likely . Slightly increasing freezing level and scattered sunny clearing up could support steepest slopes and cliffs purge . Slab triggering is likely to occur with a single skier overload . Snowpack is likely to remain susceptible to overloads over the next days , especially on shady slopes . Ski-touring possibilities are limited . Local hazard zones have to be considered appropriately .
Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) above 1800 / 2000 m in the Dolomites and Alpago . A temporary increase in natural avalanches will also be seen on southern slopes in case of sunny weather . The snow stopped falling last night and the skies have started to clear this morning . The snow limit has remained almost constant at 1200 - 1600 m in the Dolomites and 1500 - 1700 m in the Prealps , although it has dropped lower locally . Overall , 30 - 40 cm of snow fell at 2000 m in the Dolomites , with peaks of over 50 cm in the Agordine Dolomites and 5 - 20 cm in the Prealps at 1600 m . Above 2700 m , the snowpack from residual precipitations at the end of October presents depths of over one meter in many shady locations . The avalanche hazard is generally limited to above 1800 / 2000 m , where releases and natural avalanches of wet snow are possible on the steeper slopes - particularly if grassy . The most critical situations could be seen above 2300 / 2500 m , especially on shady slopes , where old snow with a compact , smooth surface is found . The wind which accompanied the precipitations has lead to the formation of drifts and cornices in some locations at an altitude .
Natural avalanches of wet snow are to be expected on many steep , southern slopes with the return of the fair weather . In the Dolomites and Alpago , the avalanche hazard will rise temporarily to marked ( level 3 ) on Saturday above 2000 m . The weather is forecast to improve over the weekend , with a gradual but significant rise in temperatures from Saturday ( Saturday , lows of 0 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2000 m ) . Starting from the late morning , the avalanche hazard will be marked ( level 3 ) in the Dolomites and in Alpago and will be low in the Prealps and at low altitudes on Friday and Saturday . Slab avalanches of recent snow are to be expected above 2000 m on grassy , sunny slopes , couloirs and slopes at the base of the rocks . Dropping temperatures at night will temporarily consolidate the snow , gradually reducing natural releases . On Sunday , the avalanche hazard will be moderate ( level 2 ) in general . 15 16 17
Conditions for excursions on the snow will be favoured by the fair weather and recent snow . Nonetheless , care must be taken , particularly on steep , sunny slopes and ridge areas due to the presence of snow drifts .
progressive rise in temperatures
Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) in the Dolomites for slab avalanches above 2500 m . With the fair weather , the snow that fell last week has slowly settled . However , strong winds from the N blew last night , leading to the formation of small , new drifts , mostly near the ridges . The most critical situations are found in these locations and are caused by possible releases of small surface wind slabs , even with light additional loads . These new drifts are highly visible . On average , there are 20 / 40 cm of snow on the ground at 2000 m , with greater snow depths above 2700 m , where - between the old and new snow - there is well over a meter of snow . The snowpack is present locally even at 1200 / 1400 m on shady slopes , while a continuous snowpack is present in the sun at 1800 / 2000 m on average .
Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) for slab avalanches above 2500 m , with stronger winds blowing from the North West from Wednesday . The skies will be overcast on Tuesday , when sleet is not excluded on the peaks of the Dolomites , while sunnier weather will be seen on Wednesday and Thursday . Temperatures are set to drop until Wednesday , with freezing levels at 1300 m , before rising on Thursday , with freezing levels at 2400 m . Winds will be weak on Tuesday , before becoming moderate and blowing from the North West on Wednesday . The avalanche hazard will not be subject to significant variations . As such , it will remain moderate ( level 2 ) above 2500 m in the Dolomites and low ( level 1 ) at lower altitudes and in the Prealps . New snow drifts will probably form at an altitude as the winds blowing from the North West become stronger , leading to a rising probability of slab avalanches . 18 19 20
Conditions for excursions on the snow continue to be favoured by the fair weather and recent snow today . Special care must be taken on steep , sunny slopes as a result of the daily rise in temperatures as well as on ridge areas , given the presence of new snow drifts . Stronger winds from North West are forecast for Wednesday , with a possible redistribution of the snow .
Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) in the Dolomites above 2500 m due to winds blowing at an altitude A significant snowpack is present on shaded slopes above 1200 / 1800 m and on sunny slopes above 1800 / 2000 m . On average , there are 20 / 40 cm of snow on the ground at 2000 m , with greater snow depths above 2700 m , where - between old and new snow - there is well over a meter of snow . Strong winds at an altitude have lead to the formation of significant snow drifts in all leeward areas , particularly between Wednesday and Thursday . The avalanche hazard in the Dolomites above 2300 m is moderate ( level 2 ) , but remains low in the Prealps ( level 1 ) . Local slab avalanches with even with light additional loads are possible , particularly near the ridges in leeward locations .
The avalanche hazard will in increase to marked ( level 3 ) , due to strong winds between Friday and Saturday The weather will be changeable , cold and windy during the weekend but without significant precipitations - except in northernmost areas ( Comelico , Fanes ) where up to 5 / 15 cm of snow may fall on Saturday . Winds will blow from the North West , becoming stronger on Wednesday evening , with speeds of 50 / 70 km on Saturday and gusts of 80 / 100 km . Temperatures are forecast to drop to - 12 / - 15 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2000 m on Sunday , with a noticeable wind chill effect . Starting Saturday and given the strong winds blowing at an altitude , there will be an increase in the avalanche hazard to marked ( level 3 ) , with the possibility of slab avalanches , even with weak additional loads . 21 22 23
Conditions for excursions and skiing trips will be critical , especially from Saturday onwards as a result of the strong winds blowing at an altitude - which will lead to the formation of wind slabs , drifts and ample areas of erosion in general - as well as due to the drop in temperature .
Perceived temperatures of up to - 30 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2000 m on Sunday
Between 5 and 30 cm of fresh snow has fallen over the past 12 hours . Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) . The snowfall in the Region of Veneto - with snow falling even on the plains - is slowly abating . The greatest snowfall was registered on the Prealps , and in particular in the Vicenza area ( Campomolon , 1730 m above sea level : 30 cm of fresh snow ) . In the Southern Dolomites , 20 cm were recorded at 2000 m , with lesser amounts being seen in the area north of the Province of Belluno ( 3 - 10 cm of fresh snow ) . With the low temperatures , the new snow has remained soft and the wind in the mountains which has accompanied the fair weather has started to form new drifts of soft snow near the ridges . The avalanche hazard in general is moderate ( level 2 ) . Avalanches of fresh snow are possible on steeper slopes in the Prealps above 1600 / 1800 m and at the base of the rocks . Local slab avalanches with even light additional loads are possible , particularly near the ridges in leeward locations .
Fair , cold weather . Moderate avalanche hazard ( level 2 ) due to slab avalanches . The weather is set to improve from Tuesday and will remain sunny until Thursday . Temperatures will stay low , with highs of no more than - 5 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2000 m , and weak / moderate winds at an altitude blowing from the North East on Tuesday and from the N on Wednesday . The winds will pick up and become stronger , blowing from the N with the return of the fair weather and redistributing the new snow . The avalanche hazard will be moderate ( level 2 ) due to slab avalanches . Residual avalanches of fresh snow are not excluded on steep , sunny slopes in the Prealps , where a greater amount of fresh snow has fallen . The most critical situations are confined to beyond the tree line , and in particular near the crests above 2500 m , where the stratification of the snowpack is more complex as a result of the strong winds which were seen at the end of last week . 25 26 27
Conditions for excursions and ski trips will be favoured by the fair weather and fresh snow , particularly in the Prealps , although the snow depth is still not very deep . Special care must be taken in places where the fresh snow has covered the wind slabs formed by the winds which blew last Friday / Saturday .
No phenomena to be noted
High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . Over the past 24 hours , large amounts of snow have fallen in the Region 's mountain territories above 600 - 700 m . This morning , the snow limit has risen to 1000 - 1300 m , with rain falling under this limit . 35 to 50 cm of snow have fallen at 1500 m over the past 24 hours . The snowpack has a total thickness of 80 - 150 cm in the Dolomites and 70 - 130 cm in the Prealps . Since early Monday morning , precipitations have been accompanied by even strong local winds . The avalanche hazard is high ( level 4 ) throughout the Region 's mountain territories . Even large natural avalanches may be seen on all slopes and all aspects . In many cases , avalanches may affect both access roads - particularly to the Dolomite Passes - and skiing districts in areas which are habitually more exposed .
High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . Precipitations will diminish during the course of the day on Monday , with some slight , residual snowfall possible on Tuesday in the mountain territory . A greater improvement will be seen on Wednesday . The avalanche hazard will remain high until Tuesday ( level 4 ) . The snow will begin consolidating on Wednesday , brining the avalanche hazard down to marked ( level 3 ) . Medium sized - or even locally large - natural avalanches of loose snow or soft wind slabs may be seen on all slopes and aspects above 800 - 1000 m in the Dolomites and 1000 - 1200 m in the Prealps . Access roads and skiing districts in more exposed areas could be affected . The strong winds seen while the snow was falling on the night between Sunday and Monday have favoured a partial redistribution of the snowpack , with drifts forming beyond the tree line in particular . 02 03 04
We advise against excursions and activities at an altitude , since conditions are strongly affected by the low visibility and bad weather condition . Avalanches could affect traffic as well as skiing districts .
Possible avalanches on the roads .
High avalanche hazard for natural avalanches of recent snow in the Dolomites and Vicenza Prealps ( level 4 ) . Marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) in the Verona and Belluno Prealps Another 5 - 10 cm of fresh snow has fallen over the past 24 hours , even though precipitations are gradually dying down . The current drop in temperatures ( lows of - 9 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2200 m in the Dolomites this morning and - 5 CELSIUSDEGREE at 1600 m in the Prealps ) is starting to consolidate the recent snow . Nonetheless , an overall instability remains given the significant depth of the new snow . Medium sized natural avalanches - and even ground avalanches - are possible , particularly on steep , grassy slopes at medium to low altitudes . Large , individual avalanches are also possible along habitual routes . The winds at an altitude are starting to redistribute the snow , with loosely bonded snow forming into unstable drifts with light additional loads ( single skier ) .
Marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) . The weather will take a decided turn for the better on Thursday . The day will be sunny , with milder temperatures and will see a moderate increase in mountain winds . A gradual rise in temperatures will lead to a further consolidation and settling of the snowpack , particularly under 2000 m . Natural avalanches of recent snow and numerous releases on sunny slopes are to be expected , particularly on Thursday . The wind will continue to form unstable slabs on leeward slopes , with slab avalanches being possible with even light additional loads ( single skier ) . The avalanche hazard will be marked ( level 3 ) throughout the mountain territories .
Given the conditions , we continue to advise against excursions on the snow ( ski-mountaineering , backcountry skiing etc . ) for the less expert . A good ability to assess stability conditions for the snowpack and evaluate routes will be required on Wednesday . With the return of the fair weather , individual natural avalanches may continue to affect access roads at an altitude and skiing districts .
Avalanches on access roads at an altitude .
Marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) . Medium-sized avalanches on steep slopes - particularly if in the sun - are to be expected . The night cooled the snowpack further , with lows of - 11 / - 12 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2200 m in the Dolomites and - 5 / - 7 CELSIUSDEGREE at 1600 m in the Prealps being registered . The snow on the surface is very cold ( - 15 / - 20 CELSIUSDEGREE ) and is slowly settling and becoming consolidated . In some locations , the base and inner layers of the snowpack are still loosely bonded . The most critical situations are found on steep and open slopes ( > 30 CELSIUSDEGREE ) , particularly if grassy and south facing , where a general instability remains due to the great amount of snow which has fallen . The wind from the South West has formed snow drifts beyond the tree line in many steep , leeward couloirs , which are unstable with the passage of a single skier .
Continued marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) , only gradually diminishing in the Prealps . Fair weather is forecast for the next few days , with the exception of Friday when a small amount of snowfall will be seen up to 800 - 1000 m ( 2 - 5 cm of snow ) . Lows of - 5 / - 6 CELSIUSDEGREE have been forecast at 2000 m , with stronger winds blowing from the South West starting Thursday evening . In general , natural avalanches will be coming to an end , particularly in the Belluno and Verona Prealps , where less snowfall has been registered . Numerous releases on steep slopes and habitual couloirs are to be expected on Thursday - as well as during the weekend - particularly on S to South West aspects . Medium-sized avalanches are also to be expected on very steep slopes ( > 35 CELSIUSDEGREE ) . Slab avalanches triggered by skiers ( weak additional loads ) are possible beyond the tree line on more leeward slopes and couloirs .
Avalanches on roads at an altitude will diminish , even if a greater possibility of these remains in the afternoon on Thursday . Off-piste descents , snowshoe and ski-mountaineering excursions are favoured by the excellent snowfall and the layer of fresh snow , even if it is crusty at times . Nonetheless , a good capacity to assess local conditions in terms of the stability of the snowpack and uphill and downhill routes is necessary .
Traffic may be inconvenienced in valley bottoms
Marked slab avalanche hazard beyond the tree line ( level 3 ) . A small amount of snowfall was registered at the bottom of Prealpine valleys ( Feltre 5 cm , Asiago 3 cm , Tonezza 5 cm , Recoaro 1 cm ) with small amounts of snow also falling at an altitude ( 10 cm at 1600 m ) . The snowpack is settling and consolidating at low altitudes ( 2 - 7 cm reduction in depth since yesterday ) . The inner layers are not well consolidated yet beyond the tree line , where the woods are sparse and on shady slopes . Moderate winds were also registered at an altitude , with the formation of snow drifts , which are hard to identify . Critical situations for avalanches are found on all open slopes and steep leeward couloirs , where slab avalanches may be seen with even weak additional loads ( single skier ) . Natural avalanches have diminished and are mostly limited to the slopes at the base of the rocks .
Fair weather , cold and with a MARKED avalanche hazard for slab avalanches triggered by skiers ( level 3 ) The wind will pick up at times over the next few days with the formation of FURTHER weakly consolidated drifts of recent snow . As such - mostly soft - slab avalanches may be possible on open slopes and leeward couloirs , particularly on N to South East aspects . Individual avalanches triggered by skiers may take place on very steep , shady slopes ( > 35 CELSIUSDEGREE ) which are sheltered from the wind as well . Avalanches are possible with even slight additional loads ( single skier ) . With the return of the sun , natural avalanches will increase during the afternoon , with small avalanches being possible on steep slopes , especially at the base of the rocks in the sun . 8 - 9
A good ability to assess local stability conditions for the snowpack and to chose itineraries is required beyond the tree line and when crossing open areas of the woods . This is valid for ski-mountaineers , snowshoe excursionists and off-piste skiers .
A significant wind chill is possible on Sunday at high altitudes
Moderate avalanche hazard due to slab avalanches beyond the tree line ( level 2 ) . The snowpack is temporarily well consolidated on the vast majority of the mountain territory . However , there are a number of snow drifts beyond the tree line which are moderately consolidated and unstable , generally with a heavy additional load ( for example , a person on foot , a compact group of skiers ) . A 5 - 10 cm layer of loosely bonded snow comprised of surface hoar and the snow which fell on December 5 is currently undergoing transformation and is found in the woods and on all slopes sheltered from the winds . This easily skiable layer covers a hard , compact layer . Beyond the tree line on more open ridge areas , the wind has eroded the snowpack , with the formation of even sizeable drifts , making the surface of the snow irregularly rough . The weather is forecast to take a noticeable turn for the worst . Snows are forecast even at the bottom of the valleys on Wednesday , while on Thursday the snowfall level will rise to 1400 - 1500 m in the Prealps and 1000 - 1300 m in the Dolomites . The weather will improve slightly on Friday .
Abundant snowfall forecast ( 100 - 150 cm of snow at 2000 m between Wednesday and Friday ) . The avalanche hazard will rise to high ( level 4 ) . Over the next few days - if both the snowfall and snowfall level forecast are seen - the situation will become critical again because of natural avalanches . Situation below 1600 - 1900 m : the snow on Wednesday will be dry even at the bottom of the valleys and habitual releases / small avalanches are to be expected on steep slopes on all aspects . The snowfall level will rise on Thursday , leading to the formation of a heavy layer of wet snow which will not bond with the dry snow from the previous day . As such , several small and medium-sized natural avalanches are expected on very steep slopes . Avalanches will be seen at the bottom of the valleys as well . Situation above 1600 - 1900 m : significant amounts of fresh snow will weigh down the loosely bonded surface layer which is currently in place . As such , frequent natural avalanches of loosely bonded snow are to be expected on open slopes , in ample clearings in the woods and inbetween sparse woodland . 10 11 12
We strongly advise against excursions outside controlled areas over the next few days given the snowfall forecast . The most critical situations will be at an altitude , at the base of steep slopes as well as at the base of couloirs where avalanches are habitually seen in addition to the bottom of the valleys , where rain will fall on a snowpack with a thickness of more than 15 - 20 cm . Avalanches may affect access roads at an altitude as well as exposed areas in skiing districts .
Traffic difficulties at an altitude and at the bottom of the valleys .
High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . 40 / 70 cm of fresh snow has fallen in the past 36 hours with large snow drifts forming even at the bottom of the valleys in the Dolomites . 42 cm of snow has fallen in some places - such as Agordo for example ( 611 m ) - while 27 cm of snow were seen in the Belluno Prealps , such as in Arsie ( 315 m ) . Initially , it snowed at low altitudes . However , as temperature rose , the snow limit climbed up to 900 / 1200 m in the Dolomites and 1100 / 1400 m in the Prealps . Precipitations have temporarily diminished , but they are set to increase noticeably in the next few hours . The avalanche hazard is high ( level 4 ) . Small and medium-sized avalanches are expected on steep slopes , with rain falling at even medium-low altitudes and heavy snowfalls accompanied by strong South East winds at higher altitudes . Avalanches may even be larger in size , with avalanches of wet or damp snow reaching valley bottoms as well .
The weather will continue to be disturbed , with precipitations becoming generally more intense - even strong in many areas - in the evening , particularly in the central - eastern Prealps and southern Dolomites . High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . The weather will be very disturbed until Friday morning . The snow level will be initially above 900 / 1500 m , but will later drop down to 700 / 900 m . In total , a further 30 / 50 cm of snow is forecast , with up to 60 / 70 cm of snow falling locally above 1500 / 1700 m , strong winds from the South East and dropping temperatures . The weather will be very humid and cooler on Saturday , with a few scattered showers . The snow level will be at 700 / 1000 m , and locally lower . The weather is set to take a turn slightly for the worse on Sunday , with snowfalls above 600 / 900 m and temperatures without significant variations . Moderate winds from the South East . The avalanche hazard will remain high ( level 4 ) . In particular , significant avalanche activity is expected on Thursday afternoon / evening , with medium - even large-sized - avalanches which may reach valley bottoms . At medium-low altitudes , the rain will weigh down the snow . Even full-depth avalanches of wet snow are possible , especially on steeper and grassier slopes . 12 13 14
We strongly advise against excursions outside controlled areas given the intense snowfall . The most critical situations are forecast for this afternoon / evening . As the snowfall intensifies , avalanches will continue to affect access roads - particularly at an altitude , but at lower altitudes as well .
Significant traffic problems throughout the mountains
High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . 30 / 45 cm of fresh snow has fallen at an altitude over the past 24 hours . The snowfall limit has been changeable , with rain temporarily falling even at 1300 / 1450 m in the Dolomites and 1600 m in the Prealps . The snowfall over the past few hours has been lighter than forecast . However , several - even large avalanches - were seen on Thursday afternoon / evening , affecting a number of roads . Temperatures rose during the night , with highs of - 2.4 CELSIUSDEGREE at 2600 m . Weak to moderate winds blew from the South East , with a few local reinforcements from the North North East . The avalanche hazard is high ( level 4 ) , and numerous small and medium-sized avalanches are to be expected on many steep slopes . In some cases , avalanches may even be larger in size . At medium-low altitudes , the rain has noticeably weighed down the snow . As such , even full-depth avalanches of wet snow may be seen , especially on steeper and grassier slopes . Residual precipitations are still underway at the moment , but are set to die out in the evening ( 10 cm ) .
Slightly unstable weather , with lighter precipitations . The weather will probably take a turn for the worse on Sunday . High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) throughout the weekend . The weather will be very humid and cooler on Saturday , with a few scattered showers . The snow level will be at 800 / 1100 m , and locally lower . Strong winds from the South East will be seen at an altitude in the evening . The situation will probably worsen slightly on Sunday , with snow falling above 900 / 1100 m . The avalanche hazard remains high ( level 4 ) . Medium-sized avalanches are still possible on steep slopes , while large avalanches could take place on habitual routes which have not seen any releases yet and may even reach valley bottoms . Full-depth avalanches of humid snow are to be expected at medium-low altitudes at least until Saturday , particularly on steep , grassy slopes . Strong winds from the South East are forecast and are set to transport the snow , forming large drifts - particularly near the crests . Given the situation , even large releases are not excluded in habitual areas . 13 14 15
We strongly advise against excursions outside controlled areas given the intense snowfall . The most critical avalanche situations were seen last night , but avalanches may still affect some of the more exposed roads , not just at altitude but in relatively low areas as well .
Significant traffic problems until Saturday
The avalanche hazard is HIGH ( level 4 ) throughout the mountain territories . It has been snowing at different intensities from valley to valley since Sunday night . At noon , 10 - 15 cm of snow fell at 1000 m , but traces of snow were seen up to 600 m . The rain / snowfall level is very changeable and will see a noticeable further increase today . There is a lot of snow on the ground and quantities are much greater than the usual monthly averages for the December . The rise in temperatures has not favoured the consolidation of the snow . Numerous medium-sized avalanches were seen over the last few days on historical routes , with even large avalanches reaching the bottom of the valley . At an altitude , the wind has lead to the formation of several soft snow drifts , which are hard to identify since they have been covered by current precipitations . Today , the fresh snow is wet and has bonded loosely with the recent snow , as is generally the case with the snowpack above 1000 m . The most critical situations are still caused by natural avalanches below 1600 - 1900 m , both in the Prealps and Dolomites . Medium-sized avalanches are to be expected on steep slopes and couloirs on all aspects . Given the amount of snow found on the ground , even small avalanches may damage infrastructures .
It will continue to snow until Wednesday morning , avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) for natural avalanches . High It will continue to snow in the coming days . Temperatures are set to rise noticeably on Tuesday . 60 - 100 cm of fresh snow is expected above 1800 - 2000 m . Tuesday : the most critical situations will be seen at medium-low altitudes ( below 1600 - 1900 m ) , where surface snows will be wet and the snowpack will be loosely bonded . Numerous , medium-sized avalanches are possible with a lot of snow in movement . Wednesday : avalanches at medium-low altitudes will be less frequent , but larger avalanches are more probable at high altitudes , and may even reach the bottom of the valleys . Thursday : natural avalanches are set to diminish . Slab avalanches may take place with even light additional loads ( a single skier ) . 16 17 18
We strongly advise against snowshoe excursions , ski-mountaineering and off-piste skiing . Avalanches will continue to affect traffic and the more exposed skiing districts over the next few days . The situation should start to improve gradually on Thursday .
Traffic difficulties at an altitude
High avalanche hazard ( level 4 ) . The precipitations seen over the past 24 hours were less than forecast . Nevertheless , a further 10 / 30 cm of snow were recorded above 1600 m in the Vicenza and Verona Prealps , with 5 / 15 cm of snow falling in the Dolomites and the Belluno Prealps . The snowfall level is relatively high and stands at around 1500 / 1800 m . The snowpack is humid up until medium-high altitudes . Numerous , medium-sized full-depth natural avalanches of humid snow were seen throughout the mountain territory , particularly on steep , grassy slopes , which have affected access roads in the Dolomites . Some avalanches reached the bottom of the valley on habitual routes . In general , the most critical situations are found in areas known for avalanches and on slopes which have not seen any releases yet . Total snow depths are starting to become consistent ( 150 / 200 cm ) .
High avalanche hazard on Wednesday ( level 4 ) , gradually diminishing to marked ( level 3 ) on Friday . The weather will begin to improve gradually , even if a further 10 - 35 cm of snow are forecast at 1600 m by Wednesday . With the forecast drop in temperatures , the snow / rain level will diminish to 900 - 1200 m . On Thursday , in addition of a slight snowfall above 800 m , the winds are also forecast to pick up from the North East , before rotating to North West on Friday . The snowpack will remain loosely bonded on many steep slopes . The drop in temperatures will allow the snow to start settling and consolidating . Avalanches at medium-low altitudes will begin to die down even if natural avalanches are to be expected on steep slopes ( particularly grassy ones ) with the return of the sun . Full-depth and surface natural avalanches are also to be expected at medium-high altitudes ( above 1600 - 1900 m ) , especially on Thursday with the return of the sun . 17 18 19
We strongly advise against excursions outside controlled areas , which are limited due to low visibility . A few avalanches may still affect access routes and the more exposed skiing areas . As the weather slowly improves , natural avalanches on steep , sunny slopes will become more probable during the warmest hours of the day .
Traffic difficulties
The avalanche hazard is diminishing to marked ( level 3 ) . Slab avalanches on leeward slopes and residual full-depth natural avalanches are possible . The drop in temperatures last night has lead to a general consolidation of the snowpack , particularly on the surface . Temperatures in the Prealps rose again during the day , favouring further consolidation . It has been sleeting since this afternoon in the Northern Dolomites and the Upper Agordino area as a result of the strong Stau north of the Alps . The snow is slowly consolidating in the Dolomites as well . At the moment , critical conditions at medium-low altitudes are due to residual natural avalanches on very steep open slopes . At an altitude , apart from the usual releases which follow precipitations ( even medium-sized individual avalanches ) , a strong WIND from the North North East has been eroding , transporting and depositing the snow in a significant manner . Even large snow drifts have been forming , and may lead to critical conditions locally as a result of natural avalanches . In terms of dangers to excursionists , soft snow drifts are currently forming both beyond the tree line and in clearings on the outskirts of the woods at an altitude . These are unstable even at the passage of a single , off-piste skier ( weak additional load ) and - even more so - at the passage of an excursionist with snowshoes ( heavy additional load ) .
Strong winds , marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) for slab avalanches . Natural avalanches may still be seen . Although there will be a marked avalanche hazard with a moderately consolidated snowpack in many parts of the territory , the situation will be complicated by strong winds blowing at an altitude and Foehn winds blowing at the bottom of the valleys . The most critical situations for natural avalanches will be : - at an altitude , where snow drifts may be unstable , particularly on steep couloirs and dry , even powdery snow avalanches may be seen ; - at medium and low altitudes , albeit differently from valley to valley based on the intensity of the Foehn winds , which are set to significantly warm up the snowpack , triggering wet / dry snow avalanches on steep slopes , particularly if grassy . Given the vast amount of snow on the ground , even small avalanches or avalanches on the slopes may have significant consequences . The situation will be critical on all leeward slopes in terms of slab avalanches triggered by excursionists , particularly in East South West aspects , ample clearings in the woods and areas on the outskirts of the woods itself . 19 20 21
Over the next few days , the avalanche hazard will have a lesser affect on traffic , even though there may still be some inconvenience . In terms of excursions on the snow ( off-piste skiing , ski-mountaineering , snowshoe excursions ) for the less expert , we ADVISE AGAINST routes outside the woods as well as against tackling steep slopes ( > 30 ) . CELSIUSDEGREE Given the situation , an excellent capacity to assess routes , analyse the territory and evaluate the stability of the snow is required .
Strong winds at an altitude with Foehn winds
Marked avalanche hazard ( level 3 ) , high ( level 4 ) in the Upper Agordino area . Residual full-depth natural avalanches are possible on steep , sunny , grassy slopes The snowpack is becoming progressively consolidated after the snowfall seen last week , with thicknesses of 120 - 200 cm in the Dolomites and 100 - 230 cm in the Prealps . Strong Fohn winds blew throughout the weekend , leading to the formation of large snowdrifts in all leeward locations at an altitude . These also further warmed up the snowpack at medium-low altitudes , where the snow is wet or humid under its temporary overnight melt-freeze crust . In general , the avalanche hazard is marked ( level 3 ) throughout the territory , except for the Upper Agordino , where it has remained high ( level 4 ) - particularly in the Livinallongo-Arabba area . The most critical situations are found on steep , grassy and sunny slopes and on E to W aspects at 1200 - 2200 m . Residual natural slab avalanches of wet snow may be seen throughout the day here , some of which may even be large in size . The avalanche hazard at high altitudes is general and slab avalanches may take place with even weak additional loads .
Over the next few days , the avalanche hazard will remain marked ( level 3 ) in general or locally high ( level 4 ) Over the next few days and up until Wednesday , the weather will remain fair with mild temperatures being recorded , particularly at an altitude . The winds will blow from the N and Fohn conditions will be seen in some valleys . Temperatures are set to drop on Thursday as the cloud cover increases . The avalanche hazard will remain marked ( level 3 ) overall , or high ( level 4 ) locally in the Upper Agordino . Natural slab avalanches of humid snow are to be expected on steep , sunny slopes , particularly grassy ones . The rise in temperatures at an altitude may lead to a further increase in the number of natural avalanches seen up to 2200 - 2300 m . The hazard from slab avalanches with weak overloads will remain general at high altitudes , given the strong winds . 23 24 25
