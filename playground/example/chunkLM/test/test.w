Last weekend 's snowfalls , still ongoing , have added on average 30 - 40 cm of fresh snow at 1800 m , with up to 60 cm on the Canin range . The fresh snow does not bind perfectly with the thick underlying layers . At high elevations , the snowpack has been drifted by the wind and has formed conspicuous accumulations on all sides and especially on northern ones . The snowpack is not well settled yet , especially above the tree line . Hence , avalanches of loose snow and slabs may be released naturally in not yet discharged avalanche - prone areas . The discharge of mid-sized slabs may be triggered also by a light load and below the tree line .
